# Tree Gen
## Background and overview
 Tree Gen is a tool to dynamically generate 3D models of trees based on specifications the user inputs. 
 You can set the height, width, branch number, leaf number, color, and the speed at which the leaves fall off and regrow on the tree.
 And then once you create it, you can look around at it and watch the leaves floating in the air from any angle you want.
 
 ## Functionality and MVPs
 * Create a base tree trunk and set it's height and width.
 * Set how many branches the tree should have and how many branches those branches should have
 * Set how many leaves each tree branch should have and their size/color

 ## Architecture and Technologies
 * Javascript for basic logic to handle input and generate trees
 * three.js for 3D
 
 ## Implementation timeline
 * Research three.js implementation and create trunk of tree - 2 days
 * Create branches - 1 day
 * Create leaves - 1 day

## Bonus
* Have the leaves fall and regrow on the tree
 * Move a premade character around the tree to see it from any angle
